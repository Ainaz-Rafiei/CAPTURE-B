Convex-hull Analysis and PRISM-based Uncertainty Testing in Radiological Embeddings for Breast pathology

This project explores a pipeline for analyzing breast pathology images using a multimodal transformer model (PRISM). It generates image captions across different noise-injected latent representations, quantifies uncertainty through repeated runs, and visualizes semantic clusters using PCA and DBSCAN with Convex Hulls. The system integrates zero-shot classification between ductal and lobular carcinoma prompts, enabling interpretable caption analysis and decision uncertainty estimation.
